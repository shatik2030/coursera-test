            <p>
            	Sushi is a very healthy meal! It's a good source of heart healthy omega-3 fatty acids thanks to the fish it's made with. Sushi is also low in calories – there's no added fat.The most common type is nigiri sushi – fingers of sticky rice topped with a small filet of fish or seafood. On average, one piece of sushi nigiri has about 70 calories.
